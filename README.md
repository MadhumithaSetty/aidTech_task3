Student Record Management System

Create a program that can manage student records, including adding new students, removing students, and displaying student information.

Steps to create the project:

1. Define a Student class that contains information about the student, such as name, roll number, address, and phone number.

2. Implement a Student Record class that contains an array or list of Student objects.

3. Create methods for adding a new student to the record, removing a student from the record, and displaying student information based on the roll number or name.

4. Implement a user interface using Java Swing or JavaFX to allow users to interact with the student record system.

5. Save the student record to a file and load it back when the program starts.
